banneRPG
==================================================

banneRPG is a very old experimental study to see if a 2D platform game could be build using only HTML5 features.

It was really usefull to understand how a simple game engine with resources, sprites, animations, collisions and geometry could be used by javascript.

If you wish to see the UML diagram describing the demo use [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/) opening the file: banneRPG_UML.zargo

The code could be completely rewritten with better libraries ( i wrote it a long time ago ;) ).
For example the resource loader could be replaced by [systemJS]( https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs ) and the sprite aninmation system needs tons of improvements.

However I hope this little demo could help other people like it helped me to understand how simple 2D platform engines works.

After building this little demo, creating a 2D platform using [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) became easier and faster.
